- finding an operatable boilerplate: symfony 4 + docker + mysql + xdebug
- integrate mysql service: issues with connection: docker container interference bug (no signs for this at all: evil)
- integrate xdebug
- intalling encore: issues, installing by symfony docs, found a bug
- building symfony controllers+twig: homepage+quiz
- first push to git repo
- integrate encore by another way: succeeded
- issues with admin login: symfony make auth command drives me to a bug - no resolution found
- integrate jQuery, timer
- 10 hours passed
- working with symfony authenticator, making user+auth


extra notes:
- no translation used in strings (nor in php, nor in twig): it was faster
- the fliptimer jquery plugin is not an npm, it has been downloaded to the assets folder: it was faster
- all js has been wrote into app.js, not in separated files: it was faster
